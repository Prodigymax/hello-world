# hello-world
Hi stutern,

My name is Gbolahan. I am a Chemical Engineer (PGD and M.Sc), though I had my first degree in Electrical/Electronic Engineering.
The interest into learning to write codes developed 6years ago but, there was nobody around me that had such knowledge not until late last year. That I started Html, CSS and Bootstrap now I am presently learning Javascript.

I really need guidance at this stage.
